        | user   | per_page |
        | wycats | 45       |
      And I make request within a cassette named "pagination/repos/list"
    Then the response status should be 200
      And the response type should be JSON
      And the response should have 45 items

    When I request next page within a cassette named "pagination/repos/list/next"
    Then the response status should be 200
      And the response should have 45 items
